We've covered how difficult it can be when you're the new person joining a dev team, and how often the documentation is outdated, on our blog.

It is because of this common challenge that we've created this repository of Docker build scripts. 
While the scripts included here are intended to serve as examples, many of them can be dropped into the root of existing projects and "just work".
We hope you find them useful.
